# About me
My name is Samantha Archie. I'm a Master's in Public Policy and Management - Data Analytics student at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests are in public health, international development, women's rights, and sports analytics. I've done public health and international development research at several non-profits and research organizations, like Innovations for Poverty Action, the International Rescue Committee, and FHI 360. I am an alumna of the University of Southern California, where I recevied a degree in International Relations and Economics, as well as a minor in Global Health. I was awared the prestigious David L. Boren Scholarship in 2016 (Swhahili, Tanzania) and the Princeton in Africa Fellowship in 2019 (International Rescue Committee, Sierra Leone).  I've lived and worked in the US and spent several years in Sub-Saharan Africa (mostly Tanzania, Liberia, and Sierra Leone with visits elsewhere).

Some fun facts about me: 
- I'm an amazing baker. I've won the Great Durham Bake-off Competition!
- I'm an avid traveler.
- I teach swim lessons. My students have been as young as 6 months and as old as 70.
- I'm a big women's college basketball and football fan. Fight On!

# What I hope to learn
I have a few different career interests. The most relevant one to this class is that I want to pursue a career in global health. I'm interested in using machine learning and spatial data in concert with novel data sources (i.e. cellphones, social media) to track disease outbreaks. 
A divergent interest is to pursue a career in sports analytics with a specific focus on women's sports and improving the data and models in this growing area.
